# Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data to identify factors contributing to customer attrition and provide insights to improve customer retention.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze customer churn data, identify key factors contributing to customer attrition, and develop insights that can help improve customer retention strategies.

## Step-by-Step Procedure
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered customer churn data from relevant sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis using Python libraries.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzed the dataset to uncover trends and factors affecting customer churn.
4. **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns and relationships between variables.
5. **Insights Development**: Identified critical factors, such as contract type, value-added services, and payment methods, that influence customer churn.

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed that customers who do not use value-added services, have month-to-month contracts, and use electronic checks for payments are more likely to churn. These insights can help develop strategies for improving customer retention.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and processing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing and running the analysis.

## Outcome
The project helped in identifying key factors affecting customer churn and provided actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Load the customer churn dataset into the Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the analysis and generate visualizations to interpret the results.
